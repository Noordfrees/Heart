# Heart
Yet another Hearts-like game. Written in Java.

## Getting Started

No installation needed. Just clone or download the repository and run `javac Game.java` in the base directory. You need to have a Java Development Kit, version 8 or later, installed in order to use `javac`. I recommend OpenJDK.

After compiling, you can start Heart from the base directory using `java Game`.

## The Game
